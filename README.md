The goal of Lotus is to create sound money that is usable by everyone in
the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will
dramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity. The project
aims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and
protocol upgrades that will enable peer-to-peer digital cash to scale many
orders of magnitude beyond current limits.

What is Lotus?
---------------------

[Lotus](https://givelotus.org/) is a digital
currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It
uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing
transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
Lotus is a descendant of Bitcoin.

What is Bitcoin ABC?
--------------------

Bitcoin ABC is the name of open-source software which enables the use of
Lotus. It is a fork of the [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org)
software project.
